## Codebase Patterns
- Models inherit from `Base` in `app/db/base_class.py`, registered via import in `app/db/base.py`
- Routers registered in `app/main.py` with try/except pattern for optional loading
- Alembic migrations use custom revision IDs like `mdm_XX_description`, chain via `down_revision`
- Latest migration: `mdm_13_sched_existing` (chain: mdm_10 → mdm_11 → mdm_12 → mdm_13)
- Use `.venv/Scripts/python.exe` for running Python (Windows WSL2 with Windows venv)
- No mypy installed; quality checks = import test + app startup test
- Numeric fields: `Numeric(18, 2)` for financial values
- Pydantic schemas use `class Config: from_attributes = True` for ORM mapping
- Seed data from xbrl_mapping.py: deduplicate (riclass_code, description) pairs across IFRS/ITGAAP dicts
- Router convention: `APIRouter(prefix="/...", tags=["..."])` with `Depends(get_db)` for session
- Git identity: `git config user.name "Ralph Agent"` needed on first commit
- CE subtotals (EBITDA, EBIT, TOT_AMMORTAMENTI, etc.) are used by cruscotto, relazione_ai, cflow — splitting detail lines is safe
- CE_STRUCTURE entries with empty `riclass_codes` are computed manually in the projection loop, not via growth/seasonality
- Adding new CE detail lines: update CE_STRUCTURE + computation block + TOT_COSTI_PROD + EBITDA subtotals in ce_projection.py

## 2026-02-02 - BE-001
- What was implemented:
  - Created `LkpContoSP` and `LkpContoCE` models in `app/db/models/lkp_conti.py`
  - Created Alembic migration `mdm_11_lkp_conti` that creates and seeds both tables
  - Extracted 134 SP accounts and 115 CE accounts from xbrl_mapping.py (deduplicated)
  - Created `GET /api/v1/conti/sp` and `GET /api/v1/conti/ce` endpoints in `app/api/routers/conti.py`
  - Registered router in `app/main.py`
  - Registered models in `app/db/base.py`
- Files changed:
  - `app/db/models/lkp_conti.py` (new)
  - `app/api/routers/conti.py` (new)
  - `alembic/versions/mdm_11_lkp_conti.py` (new)
  - `app/db/base.py` (added import)
  - `app/main.py` (added router registration)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The xbrl_mapping.py has 4 dicts: IFRS_TO_SP_RICLASS, IFRS_TO_CE_RICLASS, ITCC_TO_SP_RICLASS, ITCC_TO_CE_RICLASS
  - Each maps XBRL concept -> (riclass_code, description) tuple
  - Unique (code, desc) pairs = seed data for chart of accounts
  - Code slugification: normalize unicode, replace non-alphanum with underscore, uppercase
  - Some descriptions appear in both SP and CE (e.g., "Imposte differite") — use suffix to disambiguate PK codes

## 2026-02-02 - BE-002
- What was implemented:
  - Created Alembic migration `mdm_12_fin_existing` adding `is_existing`, `debito_residuo_iniziale`, `rate_rimanenti` columns to `mdm_nuovo_finanziamento`
  - Created `POST /cases/{slug}/upload-finanziamenti-esistenti` CSV upload endpoint in `app/api/routers/finanziamenti.py`
  - CSV grouped by label → one MdmNuovoFinanziamento(is_existing=True) per label with MdmFinanziamentoSchedule rows
  - Verified banca_projection.py already includes existing schedules in RATA_FINANZIAMENTI (via get_all_finanziamenti_by_period which queries all finanziamenti regardless of is_existing)
  - GET /cases/{slug}/finanziamenti already returns is_existing flag (schema already had it)
- Files changed:
  - `alembic/versions/mdm_12_finanziamenti_existing.py` (new)
  - `app/api/routers/finanziamenti.py` (added upload endpoint)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The model and schema already had is_existing, debito_residuo_iniziale, rate_rimanenti fields — only the migration was missing
  - `get_all_finanziamenti_by_period` already distinguishes existing vs new (skips erogazione for existing)
  - CSV upload pattern: use `csv.DictReader`, `defaultdict(list)` to group, `db.flush()` to get FK before adding schedule rows
  - Use `utf-8-sig` encoding for CSV to handle BOM from Excel exports
  - Italian numbers may use comma as decimal separator — handle with `.replace(",", ".")`

## 2026-02-02 - BE-003
- What was implemented:
  - Added `is_existing` Boolean column to `MdmScadenziarioTributario` model
  - Added `is_existing` field to `ScadenziarioTributarioListOut` schema
  - Created Alembic migration `mdm_13_sched_existing` adding `is_existing` to `mdm_scadenziario_tributario`
  - Created `POST /cases/{slug}/upload-scadenziari-esistenti` CSV upload endpoint in `app/api/routers/scadenziario_tributario.py`
  - CSV grouped by ente → one MdmScadenziarioTributario(is_existing=True) per ente with MdmScadenziarioTributarioRate rows
  - Verified `get_tributari_by_period` already queries all scadenziari regardless of is_existing, so banca_projection RATA_TRIBUTARI includes imported schedules
- Files changed:
  - `app/db/models/mdm_scadenziario_tributario.py` (added is_existing column)
  - `app/schemas/scadenziario_tributario.py` (added is_existing to ListOut)
  - `app/api/routers/scadenziario_tributario.py` (added upload endpoint + imports)
  - `alembic/versions/mdm_13_scadenziario_existing.py` (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Same CSV upload pattern as BE-002: DictReader + defaultdict grouping + flush for FK
  - Tax schedules have 3-part quota (capitale + interessi + sanzioni) vs 2-part for finanziamenti
  - `get_tributari_by_period` aggregates `importo_rata` (sum of all quotas) — no filtering on is_existing needed
  - The scadenziario model didn't have is_existing before (unlike finanziamenti which already had it)

## 2026-02-02 - BE-004
- What was implemented:
  - Added `DepreciationRates` model to `app/schemas/assumptions.py` with 4 rate fields (fabbricati 3%, impianti 15%, attrezzature 25%, immateriali 20%)
  - Added `depreciation` field to `AssumptionsData` with default factory for backward compatibility
  - Split CE projection from 2 depreciation lines (AMMORT_MATERIALI, AMMORT_IMMATERIALI) into 4: AMMORT_MAT_ESISTENTI, AMMORT_MAT_NUOVI, AMMORT_IMMAT_ESISTENTI, AMMORT_IMMAT_NUOVI
  - Existing depreciation: rolling balance × rate / 12, decreasing as assets deplete
  - New depreciation: difference between growth-projected total and existing (driven by CE growth_rates)
  - Updated SP projection to sum 4 depreciation lines for immobilizzazioni reduction
  - Verified cruscotto.py, relazione_ai.py, cflow_projection.py all use subtotals (EBITDA, TOT_AMMORTAMENTI, etc.) which are correctly computed — no changes needed
- Files changed:
  - `app/schemas/assumptions.py` (added DepreciationRates, added depreciation field to AssumptionsData)
  - `app/services/ce_projection.py` (4-line depreciation split, SP riclass import for opening balances)
  - `app/services/sp_projection.py` (use 4 depreciation lines instead of 2)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - cruscotto.py and relazione_ai.py only use subtotal CE line_codes (EBITDA, EBIT, UTILE_NETTO, TOT_AMMORTAMENTI) — splitting detail lines doesn't affect them
  - cflow_projection.py uses TOT_AMMORTAMENTI as add-back — also unaffected by detail line splits
  - CE_STRUCTURE entries with empty riclass_codes `[]` are computed manually in the loop (not via growth/seasonality)
  - SP riclass codes have "SP_" prefix, CE riclass codes have "CE_" prefix — both stripped when loading
  - Opening immobilizzazioni nette = lordo + fondo (fondo is negative in SP), so adding them gives net value
  - The `aliquota_ammort_impianti` is used as weighted average for all material assets (simplification)

## 2026-02-02 - BE-005
- What was implemented:
  - Added `pct_tfr` field (default 0.0691 = 6.91%) to `CeDrivers` in `app/schemas/assumptions.py`
  - Added `ACCANTONAMENTO_TFR` CE line in `ce_projection.py` CE_STRUCTURE (after COSTI_PERSONALE)
  - TFR accrual computed as `abs(COSTI_PERSONALE) × pct_tfr` each month
  - Included ACCANTONAMENTO_TFR in TOT_COSTI_PROD and EBITDA calculations
  - Updated SP projection: `fondi` (TFR liability) now grows by monthly TFR accrual
  - cflow_projection.py already tracks DELTA_TFR from SP TFR line — no changes needed
- Files changed:
  - `app/schemas/assumptions.py` (added pct_tfr to CeDrivers)
  - `app/services/ce_projection.py` (new CE line, TFR computation, updated subtotals)
  - `app/services/sp_projection.py` (TFR liability grows by monthly accrual)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Adding new CE detail lines requires updating 3 places in ce_projection.py: CE_STRUCTURE, the computation block, and both TOT_COSTI_PROD and EBITDA subtotal calculations
  - cflow_projection.py already reads DELTA_TFR from SP TFR line changes — so making fondi dynamic automatically flows through to cash flow
  - New CE line with empty riclass_codes `[]` = manually computed in the loop (not driven by growth/seasonality)
  - Backward compatibility: pct_tfr has a default value, so existing assumptions without it will use 6.91%
